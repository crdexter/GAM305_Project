#  Periculum

## Overview
This project is a side scrolling shooter with platformer elements that was part of a group project and has since been expanded upon by myself. This project involves the player moving through a “test facility” navigating traps and enemies to make it to the end and escape. The project showcases a wide variety of elements in UE4 from game physics with the changes made to the players jumping mechanic to UI/UX design of the player HUD and menus. Unlike other projects this one was meant to be a mostly completed artifact.

## Skills I would like to showcase

* Advance understanding of game development in Unreal Engine 4
* Blueprints architectural understanding and creativity
* Level design
* UI/UX development
